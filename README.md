# A Text Analysis of Virginia Woolf Texts

Virginia Woolf´s book long essay " A Room of One´s Own" was first published 1929. It is based on two lectures she held in 1928 and it is one of her most famous works. Specifically well known is her statement that a woman has to have money and a room of one´s own in order to be able to write. 

Woolf is a key figure in the history of women´s writing. Especially in the 70´s and 80´s it was a very important subject in French feminism and the feminist movement around Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva. 

One chapter that really astonished and moved me was her third chapter where she writes about what would have happened if Shakespeare had been a woman. Here, she also writes about female suicide which made me think about her own suicide in 1941. 

Hence, I would like to analyse how her sentiment was in her texts. Only looking at one work will not be enough to answer this question. However, I want to explore this field of research further in the future.
